In the terminal, run your PHP file directly:
This will execute your script and create the personen.xml file.
```
php xmlerzeugen.php
```

If you want to start a PHP development server to serve your files over HTTP, run:
```
php -S localhost:8000
```
Then you can access your files at http://localhost:8000 in the browser.
